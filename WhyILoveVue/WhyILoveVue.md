# Why I love Vue!

In my first real world large single page application, I was able to get things up and running with relative ease and learned new things really quickly. Here are some of the things I really like.

- VueCLI / UI
- VUE file
  - Template
  - Script
  - Styles
- Vue Router
  - Route protections
  - Route parameters
  - Nested Routes
- Vuex and State Management
  - Modules and Name Spacing
  - FLUX Design Pattern
  - MapState and MapGetters
